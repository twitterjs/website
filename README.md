# twitter.js website

The website currently only consists of autogenerated jsdoc documentation. It will take me some time to start working on building a custom website for the docs. Until then only the `gh-pages` branch will get updates generated by jsdoc.

# what is twitter.js?

twitter.js is a highly object-oriented JavaScript library that works as a wrapper around the Twitter API v2. Check out the source code of twitter.js [here](https://github.com/twitterjs/twitter.js). Contributions are welcome.
